Knowing we were all in this shared experience to further ourselves through this (possibly) new skill-set, I began to think how beneficial a space to approach projects based on what sparks our coding interests, and what we had to offer from previously established knowledge bases (ie. soft skills and industry awareness).<br><br>So, we have an array of skill-sets and drive but, not everyone has an idea just jumping out in the directions they‚Äôd like to explore. With the aid of filtered feeds based on preferences, one can create, browse, collaborate and/or follow projects and cohorts/clans of interest as they further their skill-sets solidifying their working knowledge in an environment designed to bridge the gap between learning, doing, and being." ,
