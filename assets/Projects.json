Alongside making the sandwiches correctly, the goal is to handle the cue as optimally as possible by preloading it, and slicing as many of the like-sandwich components as you can, at the same time.",

           "lessons":"Upon undertaking this project, I had the opportunity to explore and combine many of the learned skills from the first portion of my bootcamp up until Javascript. Although not complete(due to its ambitious nature for the time allotted), I still had the opportunity to utilize aspects of the AGILE process when coming to the point that it’s be more beneficial to refactor my code for the results I’m looking to achieve(which I am in the process of in between projects). After observing what data was needing to be handled and how, it became apparent that there was not just a dryer but more effective way to structure/handle the data and its interactions(state and effects)",

Throughout the project we implemented  AGILE/Scrum methodologies while holding true to our established MVP and adding possible  features in the allotted time. The main focus of our MVP was to ensure we were covering all the C.R.U.D. functionalities; rendering it fullstack, while still displaying some of the other intended features and functionalities of the user experience.",
